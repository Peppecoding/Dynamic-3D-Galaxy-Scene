# Dynamic 3D Galaxy Scene

This repository contains a web-based application that visualizes a dynamic 3D galaxy using WebGL and the Three.js library. The galaxy consists of a particle system that simulates thousands of stars to create a mesmerizing, rotating galaxy effect.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Scene:** Navigate through the galaxy using mouse controls.
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusts to the size of the viewing window.
- **Dynamic Particle System:** Uses additive blending for visual effects that simulate starlight.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

You need to have a modern web browser that supports ES6 modules and WebGL:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

# Dynamic 3D Galaxy Scene

This project visualizes a dynamic 3D galaxy using WebGL and the Three.js library. The interactive scene allows users to explore a galaxy represented by thousands of moving particles, simulating a stunning, rotating galaxy effect.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
   
   Simply double-click the file to open it in your default web browser. No web server setup is required since all scripts are loaded directly from a CDN.

- **Zoom:** Scroll up or down to zoom in or out.
- **Rotate:** Click and drag with your mouse to rotate the view.

## Built With

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** - A cross-browser JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- **[OrbitControls.js](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls)** - Provides camera orbit controls, enhancing the interactive experience.
